# MolecularCrystalTools
Collection of tools for analysing molecular crystals

`unwrap_cell.py` 
Unwrap periodic boundaries in an extended XYZ file so that connected atoms (by covalent-bond cutoff) are placed in contiguous images.

`overlay_molecule.py`
Takes an input unit cell (intended as a known crystal structure) and a predicted unit cell
(intended as an output of a crystal structure prediction) and overlays the predicted cell on top of the known one.
